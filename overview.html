<p style="text-align:center"><b>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.

Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8° 4' and 37° 6' north, longitudes 68° 7' and 97° 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km. The total length of the coastline of the mainland, Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 7,516.6 km.

	<td> &nbsp <h3> &nbsp  National Flag: Tiranga</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center"> &nbsp In 1904, the first ever Indian flag that came into existence was designed by Sister Nivedita. For some time, this flag was also known as Sister Nivedita’s Flag. The flag had two colors – red and yellow. The freedom struggle was represented by red color and victory by yellow color. On the flag was written Vande Mataram in Bengali and it also had a figure of vajra (a kind of a weapon) and a white lotus at the centre.

Then came the flag that was hoisted at the Parsee Bagan Square, Calcutta on 7th August 1906. This flag had three equal horizontal stripes or bands of blue, yellow and red color. The uppermost blue band had eight stars with varied points to represent different stages in which the lotus flower blooms. Middle yellow band had Vande Mataram written in Devanagari script. Sun and star at each end and a crescent were present on the lowermost yellow colored band.

The ‘Saptarishi Flag’ was designed by Madam Cama. The flag was first hoisted in Paris and then on August 22, 1907 in Stuttgart at the International Socialist Congress. Quite similar in looks with the above mentioned flag, the Saptarishi Flag’s topmost strip was of saffron color having one lotus flower and seven stars showing the Saptarishi.

Then there were many variations of tricolor flags available that were similar to the above mentioned flags. One of these had eight lotus flowers on the uppermost strip representing the eight provinces of British India.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Bird: Peacock</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center"> &nbsp The national bird of a country is a designated representative of that country’s fauna. It is chosen on the basis of the unique qualities that the bird may symbolize. It should uphold certain core qualities or values of the nation it belongs to. The national bird should be a prominent feature in the cultural history of the country. Another point in favor of being chosen as the national bird is the beauty that it embodies. The indigenous nature of the bird is another point while it is being considered as the national bird. Being designated as a national symbol affords the bird a special status with increased awareness and dedicated conservation efforts.

National bird of India is the Indian Peafowl commonly termed as a Peacock. Vividly colorful and exuding oodles of grace, the Indian Peafowl commands a lot of attention. The peacock and its colors are synonymous with Indian identity. It is indigenous to India and Sri Lanka, but now features in countries all over the world. Peacocks are sometimes domesticated and kept in the garden for aesthetic purposes.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Animal: Royal Bengal Tiger</h3><p style="text-align:center"> &nbsp A national animal is one of the symbolic representatives of a country’s natural abundance. The choice is based on several criteria. The national animal may be selected based on how well it represents certain characteristics that a country wants to be identified with. It has to have a rich history as part of the country’s heritage and culture. The animal should be in abundance within the country. Mostly a national animal should be indigenous to that particular country and exclusive to the country’s identity. It should be a source of visual beauty. The national animal is also chosen based on the conservation status of the animal to enable better efforts towards its continued survival due to the official status. 

National animal of India is the Royal Bengal Tiger. Majestic and lethal at the same time, these are one of the most graceful carnivores among the Indian fauna. The Royal Bengal tiger is the symbol of strength, agility and grace, a combination that is unmatched by any other animal. It is representative of all these qualities as the national animal of India. Scientific name for the Royal Bengal Tiger is Panthera tigris tigris and it is the largest of the four big cats under the genus Panthera (Lion, Tiger, Jaguars and Leopards).The Royal Bengal Tiger is among the eight varieties of tigers found in India.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Emblem</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center"> &nbsp An emblem by definition is “a heraldic device or symbolic object as a distinctive badge of a nation, organization, or family”. The national emblem of a country is a seal that is reserved for official use by the state. For a country, the national emblem is a symbol of authority and represents the basis of its constitutional philosophy. 

The national emblem of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital atop the Ashoka Pillar of Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh, and is combined with the National Motto Satyameva Jayate. The Lion Capital was adopted as the National Emblem of India on January 26, 1950. It was a declaration of the newly acquired Republic status of India. The National Emblem is used for official purposes only and demands sincere respect from the citizens of India. It acts as the official seal for all national and state government offices and is the compulsory part of any letterhead used by the government. It features prominently on all currency notes as well as on diplomatic identification documents like the passports issued by the Republic of India. The national Emblem is the symbol of sovereignty for India.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Anthem: Jana Gana Mana</h3><p> &nbsp Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by poet Rabindranath Tagore. The first stanza of the song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately 52 seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20 seconds to play) is also staged occasionally. It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.
	The poem was first publicly recited on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on 27 December 1911, and again in January 1912 at the annual event of the Adi Brahmo Samaj.

It has an equal status with Jana-gana-mana. The first political occasion when it was sung was the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress.
	It enthused numerous young men and women who fell into the patriotic sentiments of the time, dedicating their spirits in service of their Motherland. Revolutionary turned spiritualist Aurobindo Ghosh termed it the ‘Anthem of Bengal’ and rendered the English translation titled ‘I bow to thee, Mother’.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Flower: Lotus</h3><p> &nbsp The national flower of a country should tie in with the culture, history and heritage of a nation. It is meant to reinforce the country’s image to the world and play a part in upholding the qualities that the nation holds true.  The national flower of India is Lotus. It is an aquatic herb that is often termed as ‘Padma’ in Sanskrit and enjoys a sacred status among the Indian culture. It has been an integral part of the Indian culture from time immemorial. A prominent feature of the Indian mythology, the lotus is one with the Indian identity and represents the core values of Indian psyche. 

The Lotus symbolizes spirituality, fruitfulness, wealth, knowledge and illumination. The most important thing about lotus is that even after growing in murky water it is untouched by its impurity. On the other hand the lotus symbolizes purity of heart and mind. The National Flower 'Lotus' or water lily is an aquatic plant of Nymphaea species with broad floating leaves and bright aromatic flowers that grow only in shallow waters. The leaves and flowers of the Lotus float and have long stems that contain air spaces in them. The lotus flowers have many petals overlapping in a proportional pattern. The root functions of lotus are carried out by rhizomes that fan out horizontally through the mud below the water. Lotuses, cherished for their tranquil beauty, are delightful to take a look at as their blossoms open on the pond's surface.

	<td> &nbsp <h3>National Painting</h3><p> &nbsp Madhubani painting is one of the many famous Indian art forms. As it is practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar and Nepal, it is called Mithila or Madhubani art. Often characterized by complex geometrical patterns, these paintings are known for representing ritual content for particular occasions, including festivals, religious rituals, etc. The colors used in Madhubani paintings are usually derived from plants and other natural sources. These colors are often bright and pigments like lampblack and ochre are used to create black and brown respectively. Instead of contemporary brushes, objects like twigs, matchsticks and even fingers are used to create the paintings. 
Madhubani paintings originated in the Mithila region of Bihar. Some of the initial references to the Madhubani painting can be found in the Hindu epic Ramayana when King Janaka, Sita’s father, asks his painters to create Madhubani paintings for his daughter’s wedding. The knowledge was passed down from generation to generation and the paintings began to adorn the houses of the region.
